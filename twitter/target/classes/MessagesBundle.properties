TweetHelp = Thank you for using AGBTwitter. \nTo first get started you have to get your 4 twitter keys and insert them in a file called twitter4j.properties.\n To use this application you can acess everything needed on the top tool bar. \nThe first icon is a house,this is the home page. This indicates where you can find your twitter feed. In the Twitter feed you can like,retweet, reply, and save tweets to your personal database. When clicking on the reply button or retweet button you will be redirected to another page where you can enter your reply or retweet you want to write. In this feed you can also click on the users profile and this will redirect you to their profile where you can follow/unfollow or message them. \nMoving onto the second icon on the top tool bar, this is where you can send out your 260 character length tweet by typing it out and clicking "Tweet!". \nThe third icon is an envelope to indicate messages.
