Project

During the first 10 weeks of the term you will work individually on a project that will demonstrate your achievement of the appropriate objectives in this course. The project will be broken into four phases.

For Fall 2019 the project will be a Twitter client program. The four phases of this project will be:

1)	Specify and implement a user interface
	Due on September 29 11:59 PM
2)	Design, implement, and unit test the Twitter access classes and data classes.
	Due on October 20, 11:59 PM
3)	Specify and implement the classes to access a database management system
	Due on October 30, 11:59 AM
4)	Package the application and include an 	integrated help system
	Due on November 10, 11:59 PM
	
Phases 2 & 3 must include unit tests. These tests will remain a part of the project till the end.

The project will be completed by November 10, 2019 or sooner. There will be no extension. Each phase is worth 8.75 marks of the total project mark of 35 marks. 

If phases 1, 2 or 3 do not meet the requirements of that phase and receive a grade of less than 7 out of 8.75 then it may be resubmitted once as part of the next phase and can receive a maximum of 7 marks.

Failure to achieve at least 17.5/35 for the project will result in a failure in the course with a final grade of 50% (ISEP June 6, 2018, section IV, subsection 6, Grading Scheme, fourth bullet point)
