To use this application you can acess everything needed on the top tool bar. The first icon is a house,this is the home page. This indicates where you can find
your twitter feed. In the Twitter feed you can like,retweet, reply, and save tweets to your personal database. When clicking on the reply button or retweet button
you will be redirected to another page where you can enter your reply or retweet you want to write. In this feed you can also click on the users profile and this 
will redirect you to their profile where you can follow/unfollow or message them. Moving onto the second icon on the top tool bar, this is where you can send out
